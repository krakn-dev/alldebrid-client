## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Settings: Profile tab for changing login username and password
- `publish.ps1` — single script to build frontend + backend and deploy to a local install path

### Changed

- Docker: runtime base image bumped to Alpine 3.22
- Docker: `tools/docker-compose.yml` image name corrected to `krakal/alldebrid-client`
- DataPath now stamped into `appsettings.json` by `publish.ps1`; data stored under `<install>/data/`

### Fixed

- Downloader: `OutOfMemoryException` caused by chunk size never being applied to `DownloaderNET.Settings`
- Server: `GET /Api/Settings/Profile` returned HTTP 500 when API key was not set; now returns `null`
- Client: settings tabs and navbar (version, premium days) did not render on page refresh until a click triggered change detection
- Client: torrent list did not update from SignalR events because the hub callback ran outside Angular's zone
- CI: Docker image workflow now produces correct semver tags (`latest`, `1`, `1.1`, `1.1.0`)
